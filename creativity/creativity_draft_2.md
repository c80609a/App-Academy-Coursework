### Boden's Conceptual Foundation
1. What is Creativity
  * New - if you had the solution, you'd already have been there
    - P-Novelty
    - H-Novelty
  * Valuable
    - any number of combinations possible, so what makes this one work
    - what method of evaluation
  * Introspection Rarely Helps
    - often people report they have no idea how they came up with it
    - accounts of dreams or sudden insight
    - this is also normal, too much going on under the hood, would be overload

2. Neuroscience
  * Getting close
    - not be able to develop ways to predict every thought, but at least understand the mechanisms
    - a lot of the mystery of creativity is the complexity involved
    - we are starting to know which areas are involved, but not exactly how it works together

3. 3 Types of Creativity / Creative Processes
  * Combinatorial
    - "generation of unfamiliar combinations of familiar ideas"
    - analogy, juxtaposition, visual collage
    - generally occur within a very broad conceptual space
  * Conceptual Spaces
    - *TODO*
  * Exploratory
    - much like the name implies, exploring all the combinations possible within a given conceptual space
    - new set of paintings in the impressionist style
    - language, each new sentence created within grammatical rules
  * Transformative
    - the really surprising aha! creativity, something that seemed impossible
    - some defining dimension of the conceptual space has been altered, changed
    - with this fundamental change made, it paves the way for exploratory creativity to take over

4. EX - Chess Game
  * game itself is a conceptual space
  * concepts. real and theoretical include pieces, colored squares, 2D placements, rules to dictate movements, etc
  * games are played exploring this structure, different moves made, perhaps a new strategy here and there, but all within the same set of rules
  * now imagine altering the rules about pawns so that they can jump over other pieces in some way
  * suddenly, the set of available moves, countermoves and strategies expands, the way the game is played has been transformed
  * now players can spend time combining new moves and exploring the jumping-pawn-chess conceptual space

5. Complications
  * transformational tends to be everyone's favorite *TODO*
    - fun part tends to generally be when that type of transformative breakthrough happens in our understanding of science, bringing us hopefully one step closer to a more exact working understanding
    - also tend to be the ones that meet with initial resistance, and the further from the status quo, the more likely to meet difficulty
    - "creative" being a subjective definition, and culture and society being what it is, breakthroughs can often be dismissed for any number of reasons from personal to national to religious
    - the subject of 'valuation'
  * Insight vs. Process
    - what we tend to value as a single artifact or product is really the end result of a longer process of creative insight and evaluation
    - can ask then what aspect of an idea is creative, and in which way

6. Neuroscience
  * Associative Memory
    - historical example is John Livingstone Lowes sorting through all of Coleridge's material to find the references used in Kubla Khan and The Rime of the Ancient Mariner
    - since the 80s we have known there are drugs that increase or decrease the range of associative thinking
    - neural networks are now helping us test and model theories at a much faster rate
  * Relevance
    - conceptually, any concept could be associated with any other
    - must be some way of quickly assessing value, speech, for example, needs to be understood immediately and correctly
    - concept of relevance, a mechanism to select more meaningful combinations
    - evolved psychological mechanisms that determine this
      - movement naturally catches our attention
      - relevance recognition has been found to be built into our sensory systems

### Gabora's Connectionist Model
1. Intro
  * Levels of Function
    - tech like EEG, MRI and PET help us understand which areas of the brain are active
    - still no answer as to how creative solutions, too high level
    - however, representational capacity of neurons emergences across patterns, not single neurons, a single neuron too low
    - focus then on the neural mechanisms underlying the representation of concepts and ideas, looking at the level of 'distributed aggregates' of neurons
    - trouble is, we don't have fine enough tech yet to really see what's going on in real time
    - computational models help shine light on this
  * Microfeatures
    - memories encoded as neurons sensitive to ranges (values) of microfeatures
    - orientation of a line, feeling of honesty, perhaps without even a direct word to match to it
    - each neuron reacts maximally to one specific microfeature, and to lesser degrees to other microfeatures
  * 'coarse coding'
    - a memory is distributed across a cell-assembly that contains many neurons
    - likewise, each neuron then participates in the encoding of many items
    - neurons and used and reused over and over in neural reentrance
  * Content Addressable
    - systematic relationship between the content of a representation and where it gets encoded
    - (as opposed to random access memory, assigned by avail space)
    - emerges naturally through the mechanism of coarse coding, the physical proximity of similar neurons necessary in order to capture the best fit pattern
  * Relational Encoding
    - even if there isn't an exact match microfeature neuron, the fact that it is an assembly captures the essence of the microfeature by virtue of all the best-fit neurons lit up by their varying degrees
    - this system means that relationships between things are implicitly encoded, and that much more information is available that way
    - for example, if I ask you whether or not a white goat is a mammal, the answer is yes, although no one ever probably sat you down and taught you specifically that a white goat, or even a goat for that matter, is a mammal, something allows you to make that traversal easily
