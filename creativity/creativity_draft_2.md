1. What is Creativity
  * New - if you had the solution, you'd already have been there
    - P-Novelty
    - H-Novelty
  * Valuable
    - any number of combinations possible, so what makes this one work
    - what method of evaluation
  * Introspection Rarely Helps
    - often people report they have no idea how they came up with it
    - accounts of dreams or sudden insight
    - this is also normal, too much going on under the hood, would be overload

2. Neuroscience
  * Getting close
    - not be able to develop ways to predict every thought, but at least understand the mechanisms
    - a lot of the mystery of creativity is the complexity involved
    - we are starting to know which areas are involved, but not exactly how it works together

3. 3 Types of Creativity / Creative Processes
  * Combinatorial
    - "generation of unfamiliar combinations of familiar ideas"
    - analogy, juxtaposition, visual collage
    - generally occur within a very broad conceptual space
  * Conceptual Spaces
    - *TODO*
  * Exploratory
    - much like the name implies, exploring all the combinations possible within a given conceptual space
    - new set of paintings in the impressionist style
    - language, each new sentence created within grammatical rules
  * Transformative
    - the really surprising aha! creativity, something that seemed impossible
    - some defining dimension of the conceptual space has been altered, changed
    - with this fundamental change made, it paves the way for exploratory creativity to take over
  * EX - Chess Game
    - game itself is a conceptual space
    - concepts. real and theoretical include pieces, colored squares, 2D placements, rules to dictate movements, etc
    - games are played exploring this structure, different moves made, perhaps a new strategy here and there, but all within the same set of rules
    - now imagine altering the rules about pawns so that they can jump over other pieces in some way
    - suddenly, the set of available moves, countermoves and strategies expands, the way the game is played has been transformed
    - now players can spend time combining new moves and exploring the jumping-pawn-chess conceptual space
  * transformational tends to be everyone's favorite *TODO*
    - fun part tends to generally be when that type of transformative breakthrough happens in our understanding of science, bringing us hopefully one step closer to a more exact working understanding
    - also tend to be the ones that meet with initial resistance, and the further from the status quo, the more likely to meet difficulty
    - "creative" being a subjective definition, and culture and society being what it is, breakthroughs can often be dismissed for any number of reasons from personal to national to religious
