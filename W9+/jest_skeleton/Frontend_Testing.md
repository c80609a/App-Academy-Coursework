### Redux Cycle Testing
-Set Up
-Practice
-Reducers
-Action Creators
-Async Action Creators

#### Missing Component Testing in this list, due to time constraints
### Jest
- Facebook's JS Testing Framework
- Created primarily for testing React, works for other frontend as well
- simple mocking of components libraries, etc
 npm components needed jest, redux-mock-store  
 npm install --save-dev {package_name}  

 testing redux, should be pure functions, always same output for the input, no randomness, etc  

#### Reducers  


## Next Steps
- add tests to your full stack
- add tests to your javascript project
- add Jest to your resume
- add tests wherever possible on coding challenges

- Part 2 next Wednesday at 13:30 - 15:30
- A06 Prep, being a stack testing thing, you can use their tests as templates for what you are doing  :)
