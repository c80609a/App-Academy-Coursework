1. What is Creativity
  * New - if you had the solution, you'd already have been there
    - P-Novelty
    - H-Novelty
  * Valuable
    - any number of combinations possible, so what makes this one work
    - what method of evaluation
  * Introspection Rarely Helps
    - often people report they have no idea how they came up with it
    - accounts of dreams or sudden insight
    - this is also normal, too much going on under the hood, would be overload

2. Neuroscience
  * Getting close
    - not be able to develop ways to predict every thought, but at least understand the mechanisms
    - a lot of the mystery of creativity is the complexity involved
    - we are starting to know which areas are involved, but not exactly how it works together

3. 3 Types of Creativity
  * Combinatorial
    - "generation of unfamiliar combinations of familiar ideas"
    - analogy, juxtaposition, visual collage
    - generally occur within a very broad conceptual space
  * Conceptual Spaces 
  * Exploratory
