# Complexity of Creativity

## Defining Creativity?
+ One of the interesting aspects of researching this topic was when I would tell people that I was researching creativity, everyone had an anecdote or an answer
+ the same to a degree in academia, definitions of creativity tend to be domain driven, reflecting the way in which it can be perceived and represented
+ today I'd like to present an overview of the generally accepted aspects of creativity and their corresponding realms of research
---
## Creativity in General
+ At the beginning of MITs book on the neuroscience of creativity, a beautiful collection of research on creativity from different fields, they remark on the complexity of creativity, and truly it is complex
+ At it's very basis, creativity is almost universally defined as being something novel, as in new, previously unknown, and it must have value/appropriateness in a given context
---
# Key Concepts
---
## Novelty
+ Novelty or newness occurs when someone encounters something for the first time
+ Mostly, this is personal novelty, or P-Novelty
+ go on a trip to someplace new, or learning new facts or skills
+ but many others may have already have this knowledge, or been to these places, so the novelty is only for the person experiencing it for the first time
+ the flip side of this is called historical novelty, or H-Novelty
+ this occurs with new inventions and ideas that, as far as can be known, are new to society and culture as a whole
---
## P- and H- Creativity
+ just as there is personal novelty, there is personal and historical creativity
+ personal creativity is the kind of creativity that happens in daily life, finding your way out of a traffic jam, finding a proper substitution for missing ingredients while cooking, wrapping odd shaped gifts, etc
+ more than likely other people have encountered similar problems before, your solution may be unique and valuable to that specific situation, but of no wider value in a larger context
+ and then you have things like Einstein's theory of relativity, or Kekule's dream of a carbon chain becoming a ring, a new style of art or music
+ alternatively, these are sometimes referred to as little c and big C types of creativity
---
## Introspection
+ one would think, as the discoverer of a great new breakthrough, that one would know exactly how the answer was arrived at, but this isn't always the case
+ many times, scientists will document having struggled with an idea or problem for some time, and that a solution suddenly appears in a dream or sudden insight
+ the complexities of associations that lead to an insight are often thought to be outside the realm of science, left to the divine
+ as as yet, we have no clear answers as to how such creative insight can happen
---
## Creative Insight vs. Creative Process
+ something often lumped in with the idea of little c creativity vs big C Creativity is a lack of distinction between insight and process
+ neuroscience and cognitive psychology are able to go after the minute mental processes, trying to find what set of conditions might lead to a person suddenly knowing a right answer
+ genetics gets caught a bit in the middle, through twins studies we can dig deeper into some of the measurable neurological functioning, but must rely on the artifacts left behind as a measure of production to try and follow traits across families and generations
---
## The Creative Process
+ mostly, when we talk about creativity, we can only reference the end result of the process of creation
+ Preparation
+ Incubation
+ Insight
+ Evaluation
+ this isn't a static thing, multiple iterations may happen, feedback, evaluation, new selections based on that evaluation
+ we'll see this come up again in a few different ways
---
## Modes of Information Processing
+ Boden
+ Combinatorial
+ Exploratory
+ Transformative
+ these distinctions help provide a framework for consideration
---
## Combinatorial Creativity
+ combinatorial creativity is often considered a more statistical form of creativity
+ "generation of unfamiliar combinations of familiar ideas"
+ collage, music videos, poetic imagery, analogy

---
## Conceptual Spaces
+ before we get to the other two types of creativity, we have to get a bit more complex
+ combination usually happens within the conceptual space of the whole set of world-knowledge, a talking lizard for a commercial is taking the concepts of a talking being and combining with a lizard, and then anthropomorphizing it enough to be entertaining
+ but art and the sciences usually found themselves bound by rules and or some sort of limiting form
+ a haiku, sonnet, the rules of chess, the working theory of the physical world, these are all conceptual spaces
+ a conceptual space is any set of data or ideas that is accompanied by a formal structure of set of rules that defines its operation
+ another word for this is often 'domain'
+ the domain of a painter may include conceptual spaces of what types of medium she can paint with or on, or perhaps the conceptual space of cubism or surrealism
---
## Exploratory Creativity
+ exploratory creativity is then finding a solution by working within conceptual spaces
+ existing stylistic rules or conventions are used to create novel productions
+ sonnets, fugues, creations of a higher order all fall into this category
+ may not have any specifically new combinations of notes, but together the whole becomes something new
---
## Transformational Creativity
+ this is the holy grail of creativity studies
+ the impossible surprise, something new and strange that leaves no direct clue as to how you got to it
+ likened to Kekules dream of the carbon chain wiggling around and 'biting its tail like a snake'
+ a fundamental rule of the conceptual space has been dropped or altered (in this case that all molecules are strings or chains in a straight line isn't true, they can bind into rings)
+ creating a new style of art such as cubism, with its own rules and conceptual spaces to be explored
+ these types of changes are often met with resistance by the society around them
---
## Back to processes
+ the three different types of insight proposed by Boden above don't make any reference to whether that transformative insight happens suddenly or as part of a long process of learning, struggling and problem solving within a domain
+ I think this is an important addition because although neuroscience hopes to find this one 'light up' of the proper circuit or system, creativity beyond a single decision is limited to studying the cumulative effects of the process
---
# Neurological Perspectives
---
## Association
+ an interesting example of associative memory is the account of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's Kubla Khan, which he attributes to having written after experiencing an opium induced dream
+ later, John Livingston Lowes had access to the books and sources that Coleridge had read before and during writing his poems, and was able to find connections and combinations of ideas across varied sources
+ associative memory is being able to draw on one item by first drawing on some other connected item
---
## Relevance
?? on this section
+ there is truly no limit to the number of strange and unusual combinations we can make, and in the age of technology and algorithms even more so
+ but just because I can come up with a purple flying fox wearing aviators, doesn't mean it has any relevance or value
+ By what mechanism is it decided which information or solution is more relevant than another, need some sort of baseline to compare against solutions against each other
+ one theory is cost-benefit analysis, that the brain pre-analyzes computational effort, a high effort would provide a low relevance aspect, but if more implications would follow after making the computational effort, a higher relevance would be given
+ this seems fairly inefficient, and does not seem to support everyday spontaneous understanding
---
## Relevance
+ relevance recognition as an embedded system, encoded along with sensory information and memory
+ conceptual distance, how far do you have to go to make a connection to something known, relevance could in some way correlate to that
+ art provides us with a good example again, surrealism has a high conceptual distance, the brain must work to make connections and add meaning in
+ naturalism is a more straight-forward representation, the conceptual distance from what is represents is minimal beyond the constraints of representation
+ associative non-logical guessing constrained by relevance may be the mechanism by which a best fit answer is served up
+ neuroscience and cognitive psychology are still searching for all the different conceptual spaces and ways that constraints could possibly be constructed
+ caveat, we are still learning how conceptual spaces, concepts themselves, are neurally embodied

# Insight in a Distributed Content-Addressable System
---
## Neuroscience
+ generally involves studying what happens in response to a stimulus
+ information is retrieved from memory, if the answer already exists, it is utilized
+ if not, we usually make systematic use of what is there to create the answer
+ so in this context, creativity is considered to be when something new and appropriate is created that wasn't previously explicitly stored in memory
---
## At what level do concepts exist in the brain
+ "the representational capacity of neurons emerges at a higher level than that of individual neurons"
+ inner workings of neurons are too basic to explain creativity
+ instead, "focus on neural mechanisms underlying the representation of concepts and ideas"
---
## Concept Encoding
+ research shows us that neurons respond to microfeatures, for example one may respond to a certain curvature of line, the quality of honesty, relative position, etc
+ a neuron will respond maximally to one particular microfeature, but also in lesser amounts to similar microfeatures in what is called 'coarse coding'
+  a memory or concept is then distributed across what is called a cell assembly, all the different microfeatures that are activated together to encode it
+ neurons are easily reused in different capacities which is called neural reentrance
---
## Content Addressable
+ because there is a systematic relationship between content and where it is encoded, a cell assembly can be activated in which none of the neurons are responding maximally, but together the partial responses form an encoded concept all the same
+ a distributed overlap of features and the ability of have partial responses is critical for the way memory and association works
+ if everything in memory was kept in discrete containers, we would have to have a much different mental file system, and it would be much harder to create associations
+ but because similar content is stored together, neurons such as the concept of a curve, are used over and over again for each concept that is encoded that contains the microfeature of curviness
---
## Reconstructive Nature of Memory
+ memories aren't retrieved so much as reconstructed
+ the cell assembly is activated again to represent the stored content
+ again, it would be inefficient to record every single bit of data individually each time, so the content encoding system is used to activate all the microfeatures that go into building up that concept
+ but because we have reused those neurons in the meantime, and our physiological state and circumstances are now different in retrieving it, we cannot get an exact replica, we get the best fit
+ this new result is colored, even if only slightly
+ this, for example, is how eyewitness accounts can't always be trusted to be exact
---
## A Model for Creative Insight
+ distributed content addressable memory may provide explanation for associative memories due to its very nature
+ because of the shared use of neurons to store concepts, the meaning of any representation is in part shared or derived from the meanings of other representations
+ items that are similar are naturally brought to mind, the idea of conceptual distance almost becomes literal in terms of traversal and connection, how much lights up together, how much doesn't
