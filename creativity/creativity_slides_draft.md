# Complexity of Creativity

## Defining Creativity?
+ One of the interesting aspects of researching this topic was when I would tell people that I was researching creativity, everyone had an anecdote or an answer
+ the same to a degree in academia, definitions of creativity tend to be domain driven, reflecting the way in which it can be perceived and represented
+ today I'd like to present an overview of the generally accepted aspects of creativity and their corresponding realms of research
---
## Creativity in General
+ At the beginning of MITs book on the neuroscience of creativity, a beautiful collection of research on creativity from different fields, they remark on the complexity of creativity, and truly it is complex
+ At it's very basis, creativity is almost universally defined as being something novel, as in new, previously unknown, and it must have value/appropriateness in a given context
---
## Novelty
+ Novelty or newness occurs when someone encounters something for the first time
+ Mostly, this is personal novelty, or P-Novelty
+ go on a trip to someplace new, or learning new facts or skills
+ but many others may have already have this knowledge, or been to these places, so the novelty is only for the person experiencing it for the first time
+ the flip side of this is called historical novelty, or H-Novelty
+ this occurs with new inventions and ideas that, as far as can be known, are new to society and culture as a whole
---
## P- and H- Creativity
+ just as there is personal novelty, there is personal and historical creativity
+ personal creativity is the kind of creativity that happens in daily life, finding your way out of a traffic jam, finding a proper substitution for missing ingredients while cooking, wrapping odd shaped gifts, etc
+ more than likely other people have encountered similar problems before, your solution may be unique and valuable to that specific situation, but of no wider value in a larger context
+ and then you have things like Einstein's theory of relativity, or Kekule's dream of a carbon chain becoming a ring, a new style of art or music
+ alternatively, these are sometimes referred to as little c and big C types of creativity

## Introspection
+ one would think, as the discoverer of a great new breakthrough, that one would know exactly how the answer was arrived at, but this isn't always the case
+ many times, scientists will document having struggled with an idea or problem for some time, and that a solution suddenly appears in a dream or sudden insight
+ the complexities of associations that lead to an insight are often thought to be outside the realm of science, left to the divine
+ as as yet, we have no clear answers as to how such creative insight can happen
---
## Creative Insight vs. Creative Process
+ something often lumped in with the idea of little c creativity vs big C Creativity is a lack of distinction between insight and process
+ neuroscience and cognitive psychology are able to go after the minute mental processes, trying to find what set of conditions might lead to a person suddenly knowing a right answer
+ genetics gets caught a bit in the middle, through twins studies we can dig deeper into some of the measurable neurological functioning, but must rely on the artifacts left behind as a measure of production to try and follow traits across families and generations
---
## The Creative Process
+ mostly, when we talk about creativity, we can only reference the end result of the process of creation
+ Find a problem
+ Incubate
+ Select
+ Evaluate
+ this isn't a static thing, multiple iterations may happen, feedback, evaluation, new selections based on that evaluation
+ we'll see this come up again in a few different ways
---
## Modes of Information Processing
+ Boden
+ Combinatorial
+ Exploratory
+ Transformative
+ these distinctions help provide a framework for consideration
---
## Combinatorial Creativity
+ combinatorial creativity is often considered a more statistical form of creativity
+ juxtaposition is
